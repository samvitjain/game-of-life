# Conway's Game of Life

This project provides a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Vue.js and Vite. Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Demo Video

Here's a video tutorial explaining the concepts of Conway's Game of Life and how to implement it:

## What is Conway's Game of Life?

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells on a grid live, die, or multiply based on a few mathematical rules. These simple rules lead to complex, beautiful patterns emerging over time. You can read more about the game and its rules on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar). Be sure to disable Vetur if you have it installed.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TypeScript

TypeScript does not handle type information for `.vue` imports by default. To enable type-checking, we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc`. In editors, installing [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) will make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize Configuration

For more advanced configuration, refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint

This template provides a simple starting point for creating your own Conway's Game of Life implementation using Vue.js. Enjoy coding!
